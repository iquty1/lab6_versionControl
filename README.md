# lab6_versionControl

In this repository, there is a Jupyter notebook file that contains a python program that prints a users name however many times they want. It has input validation that makes sure the user enters correct input and prompts them again if their input isn't correct.

# Installation:
In order to run Lab6.ipynb you must use jupyter notebooks. Use the Pitt sci instance Jupyter https://jupyterhub.sci.pitt.edu/, or download and install jupyterlab onto your personal computer.

# Usage:
In Jupyter hit run on the cell with the code. You should be prompted for your name. Enter your name and then you will be prompted for an integer. This is the number of times your name will be printed. Type an integer and hit enter, if you type something else you will be prompted again for an integer. After your name should be printed that number of times

# Licence: We picked GNU General Public License v3.0 because the program was not for profit or anything and we felt that it was fine for anyone to use or refrence this assignment if they want to.

# Code of Conduct: We picked Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct because github reccomends it for projects of any size. In an open source project, having a code of conduct is important so that malicious people don't come in and mess things up or cause harm to others.
