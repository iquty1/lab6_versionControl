# lab6_versionControl
getting familiar with github

In this repository, there is a python notebook file that contains a python program that prints a users name however many times they want. It has input validation that makes sure the user enters correct input and prompts them again if their input isn't correct.


Licence: We picked GNU General Public License v3.0 because the program was not for profit or anything and we felt that it was fine for anyone to use or refrence this assignment if they want to.
